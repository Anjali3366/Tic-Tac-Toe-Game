# Tic-Tac-Toe Game

The Tic Tac Toe Game is a simple yet classic two-player game implemented in HTML , CSS and JavaScript . The game is played on a 3x3 grid where two players take turns marking the spaces in the grid with their respective symbols (typically "X" and "O"). The player who succeeds in placing three of their marks in a horizontal, vertical, or diagonal row is the winner. If all nine squares are filled and neither player has three marks in a row, the game is considered a draw.
